# Fast Ping

<b>I wrote this code on 10/3/2020.</b><br>
I was just scrolling through my Visual Studio Projects folder and saw this, so I thought i'd post it here for others.<br><br>
This program sends ICMP(Ping) requests to a host, and displays the response in a fashion that mimics the Windows Command Prompt.<br>
